👋 Hi! I’m **Antoine Sesini**, a **Backend Software Engineer** at [Olvid](https://www.olvid.io/fr/), the world’s first private messaging platform. I design and develop the message distribution servers that power our infrastructure.

I build and maintain services in [Go](https://go.dev) and [Java](https://www.java.com/fr/), across diverse architectures—from *on-premise* setups to VPS, Kubernetes clusters, and managed *FaaS* and *PaaS* environments. These services rely on open-source backends like [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/), [ScyllaDB](https://docs.scylladb.com/stable/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/), and [MinIO](https://docs.min.io/enterprise/aistor-object-store/), as well as networking tools such as [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/), [Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn), and [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/).

My expertise also extends to deployment and infrastructure management, with regular use of [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs) and similar tools.

My work primarily revolves around **scalability**, **availability**, **performance and cost optimization**, and—above all—**technological sovereignty**. The latter is what drives me the most: building systems that are realistic, constrained by rules we control, and free from legal or technical dependence on any external authority. This often means challenging assumptions we once took for granted, at every stage—from initial concept to final deployment (and beyond).

Learning to build and deploy differently is what inspires me to share my insights here (see [Articles](/articles/)). This blog also serves as a showcase for various public and private services I test or develop in my free time (check out the [Services](/services/) section).
